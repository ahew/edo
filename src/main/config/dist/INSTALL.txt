# Edo

This is an excerpt from the file `README.md`.

The file `README.md` contains more useful information, and you should read it once Edo is installed.

## Installation from binary package

If you obtained Edo as a pre-compiled binary package, follow these easy installation steps:

1. Copy `edo-x.y.z.jar` into a folder of your choice
2. (Optional for OS X and *nix systems) configure a shell alias like so:  
alias edo="java -jar /folder-of-your-choice/edo-x.y.z.jar"
3. Read the file `README.md` :)
